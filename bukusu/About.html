        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Bantu Language Research Resource </p>
		<p>This application currently deals exclusively with the Luyia language Bukusu. However, the general framework should be flexible enough to construct similar databases in other Bantu languages. All linguistic data currently contained within this digital language resource were collected from Maurice Sifuna as part of Dr. Michael Marlo's Spring 2015 Field Methods in Linguistics course at the University of Missouri.</p>
	

		<p>This application was developed by Ben Stockman, Jeffrey Friel, Kyle Bush, Lizzy White and Kenneth Steimel. Our goal was to provide future research endeavours directed at Bukusu with a well-organized, central location where data could be viewed, stored and edited, while maintaining a measure of security. We also sought to provide utilities, such as audio playback and on-screen keyboards with the relevant characters of the International Phonetic Alphabet, that require significant setup to add to a particular client. This, we felt, would be particularly useful in situations like public use thin clients on college campuses and libraries where adding new keyboards and downloading large audio files are commonly not permitted due to security concerns. We hope that our work facilitates the task of understanding luuÎ²ukusu.</p>
